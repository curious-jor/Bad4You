# Description
Candy is bad for you. But so are cigarettes, and alcohol, and running. <\br>
Bad4You is a browser-based life simulator. Give it your name, age, and the state you live in to get started. Then answer a series of questions about your lifestyle. Do you eat your vegetables? Do you drink soda? Do you smoke? Your answers to these questions will be compared to a collection of data. Bad4You then determines your risk of heart disease for every choice you make. See your decisions played out over the course of your life and get a sense of how those decisions affect your health.
